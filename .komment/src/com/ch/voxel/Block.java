The class has several instance fields, including `x`, `y`, and `z` which represent the position of the voxel in the grid, and `ft`, `bk`, `tp`, `bt`, `lt`, and `rt` which represent various flags or properties of the voxel. The code also includes a constructor that initializes the instance fields and sets the flags to their default values.","diagram":"digraph G {\n    label=\"com.ch.voxel.Block\"\n    bgcolor=\"#151719\"\n    fontcolor=\"#ECEDED\"\n    splines=ortho\n    fontname=\"Courier New\"\n    edge [color=\"#26de81\"]\n    node [style=filled,color=\"#717D86\", shape=rectangle, fontname=\"Courier New\"];\n    \n    subgraph cluster_main {\n        // style=filled;\n        color=\"#00000000\"; \n        Block [style=filled,color=\"#26de81\",shape=rectangle, fontname=\"Courier New\"];\n        label = \"\"\n    }\n    Chunk\n    Block -> Chunk \n}\n","items":[{"id":"3b997320-4de0-1a8c-7048-36f43401f2fe","ancestors":[],"type":"function","description":"represents a three-dimensional block with various properties, including position (x, y, z) and flags for different states (ft, bk, tp, bt, lt, rt).\nFields:\n\t- z (int): represents the block's depth in the voxel world.\n\t- rt (boolean): in the Block class represents whether the block is right-clickable.\n\n","fields":[{"name":"z","type_name":"int","value":null,"constant":false,"class_name":"Block","description":"represents the block's depth in the voxel world."},{"name":"rt","type_name":"boolean","value":null,"constant":false,"class_name":"Block","description":"in the Block class represents whether the block is right-clickable."}],"name":"Block","code":"public class Block {\n\t\n\tpublic int x, y, z;\n\tpublic boolean ft, bk, tp, bt, lt, rt;\n\t\n\tpublic Block(int x, int y, int z) {\n\t\tthis.x = x;\n\t\tthis.y = y;\n\t\tthis.z = z;\n\t\t\n\t\tthis.ft = false;\n\t\tthis.bk = false;\n\t\tthis.tp = false;\n\t\tthis.bt = false;\n\t\tthis.lt = false;\n\t\tthis.rt = false;\n\t}\n\n}","location":{"start":3,"insert":3,"offset":" ","indent":0,"comment":null},"item_type":"class","length":19,"docLength":null}]}}}
